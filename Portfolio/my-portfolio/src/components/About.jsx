        I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end applications that connect with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I think being a great developer means using the right tools for each job, instead of sticking to just one way of doing things.
